This extension for etherscan.io let you have a more intuitive visualisation of your transactions from [cryptokitties.io](https://www.cryptokitties.co).

You need to have TamperMonkey extension/add on installed in your browser. Here are the links

**Note**: I have not tested this script with other script managers, such as GreaseMonkey or ViolentMonkey. It may work with these

## Usage ##

Navigate to your address page on etherscan.io

Click on a transaction to see its details, or navigate to the Internal Transactions tab and click on the parent's transaction link.
This will open up a transactions details page, and display on top the action (bid/sale,...) and the kitties involved.
